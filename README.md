# What is QA
1. **QA** stands for Quality Assurance. Goal of QA is to verify that specific requirements are met. So a product has to have a requirements, what it should do, how it should do, how often it should do something, how much load it should take and etc. QA makes sure that the product is working as its expected to do and as much as possible, it is bug-free.
2. **QA duties** may vary depending on the product because there are different industries may it be in medical, military, government or real estate companies and many more. And it is also depending on what product it is, maybe a webpage, maybe that is an API, maybe that is a system, maybe for a backend program, maybe that is a wearable device and etc. The main goal is always the same, the product must meet the requirements and it is also bug-free and stable.
3. **What does QA test?** Almost anything that has code in it can be tested such as games, connectivity, localization, smart devices, web apps, cars, even toasters and coffee makers. The more products that are developed, and the more products that are on the market that have code and **require ongoing support**, the more QA jobs are out there. This means that QA jobs are **in-demand** and **grows exponentially**. 
4. **Who hires QA testers?** Almost every modern industry. Small startups and big corporation alike. Like gaming, medical, real estate, banking, gambling, list goes on forever.
5. **Why hire QA testers?** The first question in mind is, why not let developers test their own software? Let's say there's a world that developers didn't made a single bug in the code but there's so many interactions happening, multiple developers working on the product, multiple tools are used, there's so many modules and components of the product that the system is breaking and even if let's say developers write these unit tests and have some coverage but when bringing all these things together and bringing those to platforms, there's so many connections and interactions that developers cannot simply predict it that's why they need QA testers. The other thing is developers follows a set of instructions based on the design they developed during the planning stage. They created the software according to the specs and at the they they think it is working as expected. But when you have the tester mindset where you look for things that were missed and how can you actually interact with the system that breaks its functionalities and now you start to find a lot of issues. Bugs in products may cost millions and having major critical bugs will turn away users towards competition. Bugs may even put companies out of business. Bugs may harm users too like let's say modern cars may run into pedestrians, road navigation apps taking you somewhere else and x-ray machines might give too much radiation and etc.

QA Testers are definitely needed, it's not like we can just make a product and just deploy it without prior testing, and hoping it works and sells well. That's not how it works.

# What does QA Testers do
- Estimate, prioritize, plan, and coordinate testing activities
- Review requirements specs based on them and create test plans and test cases
- Perform testing, make sure product meets expectations & acceptance criteria
- Gather, analyze and report test results
- Open bug reports and verify they are fixed
- Build test beds, configure environments required for testing
- Participate in meetings, grooming, and other team activities
- Serve as a connection layer between developers and product owners
- Add user perceptive to requirements and suggest improvements

# Why choose QA?
- A lot of different industries to work in
- Good entry point into IT field
- Great benefits, completive salaries, comfortable working environment, WFH
